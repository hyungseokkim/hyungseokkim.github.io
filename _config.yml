about_content: |
  I'm a <mark>backend web developer</mark> with over 7 years of hands-on experience. I've worked across various industries, building <mark>ERP systems</mark>, <mark>platform APIs</mark>, and <mark>admin tools</mark>.

  My main expertise lies in backend development using <mark>Java (Spring Boot)</mark> and <mark>PHP</mark>, with strong proficiency in RDBMS such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. I've also participated in frontend development using <mark>React</mark>, gaining a broader understanding of the entire development flow.

  I follow Git Flow-based branching strategies, and actively document APIs and workflows using Notion and Swagger. I'm comfortable working in cross-functional teams with planners, designers, and other developers, and enjoy collaborative environments with agile processes like Scrum and retrospectives.
