about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am a <mark>web backend developer</mark> with 7 years of professional experience, primarily focused on <mark>analyzing and improving existing legacy systems</mark> rather than building greenfield features from scratch. I have mainly worked in real-world production environments where constraints such as service termination, data inconsistency, and undocumented codebases are common, taking responsibility for stabilizing and maintaining systems under such conditions.

  My core expertise lies in backend development using <mark>Java (Spring Boot)</mark> and <mark>PHP</mark>, with extensive hands-on experience in <mark>data modeling, migration, and integrity validation</mark> using major RDBMS such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. I have repeatedly handled data migration and verification tasks in domains where <mark>accuracy is critical</mark>, including payroll and labor-related systems.

  I place greater value on <mark>structuring problem situations and turning them into solvable tasks</mark> than on specific technologies themselves. I manage change history using a Git Flow–based branching strategy and document system behavior and APIs with Notion and Swagger for effective team sharing. In cross-functional collaboration with planners and designers, I have often played a role in clarifying ambiguous requirements and translating them into working, production-ready solutions.

  ---
  <mark>Key Strengths</mark>

  - Analyzing and maintaining legacy codebases while delivering stable functional improvements
  - Designing data migration pipelines and ensuring data integrity in systems handling Excel and CSV inputs
  - Structuring operational issues and constraints into actionable and solvable engineering problems
  - Handling data validation and processing in accuracy-critical domains such as payroll and labor management
  - Building sustainable development environments through documentation and cross-team collaboration

  ---
  <mark>Currently Learning</mark>

  - Building a deeper understanding of JVM internals, focusing on memory flow, object creation, class loading, and runtime behavior to reach an interview-explainable level

        caption: Sep 2022 – Nov 2024 (2 years 3 months)
        description: |
          Worked on a legacy-based labor consultant platform, focusing on resolving data integrity issues and improving system stability.
          Handled complex operational scenarios such as service termination, inconsistent external data sources, and sensitive payroll-related data.
  
          - Migrated data from a VB-based legacy system scheduled for service shutdown into the new Huram platform
          - Designed a step-by-step migration process (temporary tables → validation → production tables) to ensure data consistency
          - Implemented row-level failure handling to prevent entire batch failures during data migration
          - Defined validation rules based on payroll and labor domain requirements and automated migration logic
          - Analyzed PHP-based legacy codebases and gradually refactored them into API-oriented backend services
          - Improved GPS-based attendance management by redesigning encrypted location data storage
          - Participated in early-stage evaluation of a next-generation system using React and Spring Boot
  
          Tech Stack: **Java (Spring Boot)**, **PHP**, JavaScript, **React**, MySQL

        title: Wizcore Technology Lab
        sub_title: Research Engineer
        caption: May 2020 – Aug 2022 (2 years 3 months)
        description: |
          Participated in government-funded R&D projects, focusing on prototyping and technical validation rather than full-scale production services.
          Gained experience rapidly adopting new technologies and applying them to experimental service architectures.
  
          - Developed backend APIs for machine-learning-based data visualization dashboards
          - Built service prototypes using Spring Boot and React for AI-driven recommendation platforms
          - Implemented cloud storage and image labeling workflows to understand end-to-end data pipelines
          - Customized open-source solutions to meet project-specific research requirements
  
          Tech Stack: **Java (Spring Boot)**, **React**, Python (FastAPI, Django), PostgreSQL

        sub_title: Software Engineer
        caption: Jan 2018 – Apr 2019 (1 year 4 months)
        description: |
          Worked in SI/SM environments maintaining and stabilizing legacy enterprise systems.
          Took over systems after key developers left and independently handled maintenance and incident response.
  
          - Analyzed and maintained complex legacy systems developed by multiple engineers
          - Worked on finance and settlement modules requiring high data accuracy
          - Diagnosed and resolved production issues involving SQL-heavy and procedure-based logic
  
          Tech Stack: **Java (Spring + MyBatis)**, **JSP**, JavaScript, jQuery, PostgreSQL

        caption: Jan 2016 – Jul 2017 (1 year 7 months)
        description: |
          Gained hands-on experience in both frontend and backend development during early-stage web service development.
          Focused on user input handling, notification systems, and order-processing workflows.
  
          - Implemented push notification services in hybrid mobile app environments
          - Designed and developed bulk data upload features using Excel files
          - Built data normalization and merging logic to handle inconsistent user input
  
          Tech Stack: **Classic ASP**, AngularJS, JavaScript (jQuery), MSSQL, Node.js
