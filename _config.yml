about_content: |
  I'm a <mark>backend web developer</mark> with over 7 years of hands-on experience. I've worked across various industries, building <mark>ERP systems</mark>, <mark>platform APIs</mark>, and <mark>admin tools</mark>.

  My main expertise lies in backend development using <mark>Java (Spring Boot)</mark> and <mark>PHP</mark>, with strong proficiency in RDBMS such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. I've also participated in frontend development using <mark>React</mark>, gaining a broader understanding of the entire development flow.

  I follow Git Flow-based branching strategies, and actively document APIs and workflows using Notion and Swagger. I'm comfortable working in cross-functional teams with planners, designers, and other developers, and enjoy collaborative environments with agile processes like Scrum and retrospectives.

        caption: Sep 2022 – Nov 2024 (2 years 3 months)
        description: |
          Worked on a legacy-based labor consultant platform, focusing on resolving data integrity issues and improving system stability.
          Handled complex operational scenarios such as service termination, inconsistent external data sources, and sensitive payroll-related data.
  
          - Migrated data from a VB-based legacy system scheduled for service shutdown into the new Huram platform
          - Designed a step-by-step migration process (temporary tables → validation → production tables) to ensure data consistency
          - Implemented row-level failure handling to prevent entire batch failures during data migration
          - Defined validation rules based on payroll and labor domain requirements and automated migration logic
          - Analyzed PHP-based legacy codebases and gradually refactored them into API-oriented backend services
          - Improved GPS-based attendance management by redesigning encrypted location data storage
          - Participated in early-stage evaluation of a next-generation system using React and Spring Boot
  
          Tech Stack: **Java (Spring Boot)**, **PHP**, JavaScript, **React**, MySQL

        sub_title: Research Engineer
        caption: May 2020 – Aug 2022 (2 years 3 months)
        description: |
          Participated in government-funded R&D projects, focusing on prototyping and technical validation rather than full-scale production services.
          Gained experience rapidly adopting new technologies and applying them to experimental service architectures.
  
          - Developed backend APIs for machine-learning-based data visualization dashboards
          - Built service prototypes using Spring Boot and React for AI-driven recommendation platforms
          - Implemented cloud storage and image labeling workflows to understand end-to-end data pipelines
          - Customized open-source solutions to meet project-specific research requirements
  
          Tech Stack: **Java (Spring Boot)**, **React**, Python (FastAPI, Django), PostgreSQL

          Worked in SI/SM environments maintaining and stabilizing legacy enterprise systems.
          Took over systems after key developers left and independently handled maintenance and incident response.
  
          - Analyzed and maintained complex legacy systems developed by multiple engineers
          - Worked on finance and settlement modules requiring high data accuracy
          - Diagnosed and resolved production issues involving SQL-heavy and procedure-based logic
  
          Tech Stack: **Java (Spring + MyBatis)**, **JSP**, JavaScript, jQuery, PostgreSQL

          Gained hands-on experience in both frontend and backend development during early-stage web service development.
          Focused on user input handling, notification systems, and order-processing workflows.
  
          - Implemented push notification services in hybrid mobile app environments
          - Designed and developed bulk data upload features using Excel files
          - Built data normalization and merging logic to handle inconsistent user input
